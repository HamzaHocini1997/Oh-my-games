<h3>Question</h3>
<P>1. How hard is video game design?</P>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<P>It’s challenging, and also rewarding. Designing games is not the same as playing them—designing takes hard work and time. But, if you put the time and effort in, you can build games you’re proud of.</P>
<h3>Question</h3>
<P>2. How do you design a video game?</P>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<P>Video games can take many forms—anything from a text-based web browser game to a AAA console release. Designing a game starts with an idea. It’s completed with drive and time (we’re leaving out a lot of steps here!).</P>
<h3>Question</h3>
<P>3. How long does it take to design a video game?</P>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<P>The time it takes to design a video game depends on the scope of the game. Big AAA titles can take years. A simple game could take you an afternoon to build (especially if you’re well-versed in a programming language or particular game engine).</P>
<h3>Question</h3>
<P>4. What programming languages do I need to know for game design?</P>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<P>Java and C++ are common choices. If you know you want to work in Unity, C# is a good option. It depends on the kind of games you want to design and the engines you want to use, but these programming languages are a good starting point for many aspiring game designers.</P>
<h3>Question</h3>
<P>5. What is a game design document?</P>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<P>A game design document is your one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about the game you’re creating. Your team fills it with all the info you need regarding the concepts, ideas, aesthetics, mechanics, characters, plot, features, etc. that you’ll include in the game.</P>
<h3>Question</h3>
<P>6. Do you need to know how to code to design video games?</P>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<P>It can definitely help, but coding isn’t necessary to design video games (especially if you know people (or have a team) who can code. There are also game engines that let you develop games without knowing any code.</P>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. What is the difference between game design and development?</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>The easiest way to think about it is this—game design is creating the main ideas of the game. It’s the creative side. Game development is turning this vision into an actual game. It’s the programming side.</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>8. What is the best video game engine?</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>The “best” video game engine is whatever program best allows you to realize the vision of your game. Two of the most popular or “industry standard” engines are Unreal Engine and Unity.</p>
